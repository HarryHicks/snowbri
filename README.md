# Snowbri ❄️

Welcome to the Snowbri discord bot repo page! Built by Hicksy#2047 and submitted into SnowCodes Winter 2022, thi sbot brings the snowball fun to you!

## Basic Information

During Snowsgiving 2021, there was a bot, and that bot was Snowball Bot. The fun it brought in communities across discord was amazing. However, come Snowsgiving 2022, the bot stayed offline, and a new very janky bot was released. Knowing how much fun many had with the origonal bot, I decided to recreate it!

So, this bot is similar to the Snowball bot, yet with stats and some more hidden features, as well as some future QOL and development changes. I have some artists working on some exclusive art for the bot, while I continue to think and make small updates.

So, to the judges, and to anyone wanting to add the bot. I hope you enjoy it, and I hope your server friends enjoy it too!

| Commands  | Function  |

| /throw [member]  | Pick your target carefully and throw the snowball you collected at them! |
| /stats [member]  | Include no member mention to check your own, or mention someone else to see their hit and miss stats! |


## Developer information

I decided to use hybrid Dpy commands over pure slash Dpy or Djs for multiple reasons:

- Hybrid commands -> allows the bot to be used for slash commands, or using the prefix "snowbri " should slash commands not be allowed for specific users in the guild. 

- Dpy > Djs -> I have been using Dpy and Python for much longer than I have JavaScript and Djs. Instead of developing something in a restircted time limit (5-8 days before the SnowCodes, and to get it out in time for early December for max use), I decided to build the bot in something I am more comfortable with, yet is able to be developed to be more complex than the other bot.
