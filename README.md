# Snowbri ❄️

Welcome to the Snowbri discord bot repo page! Built by Hicksy#2047 and submitted into SnowCodes Winter 2022, thi sbot brings the snowball fun to you!

## Basic Information

During Snowsgiving 2021, there was a bot, and that bot was Snowball Bot. The fun it brought in communities across discord was amazing. However, come Snowsgiving 2022, the bot stayed offline, and a new very janky bot was released. Knowing how much fun many had with the origonal bot, I decided to recreate it!

So, this bot is similar to the Snowball bot, yet with stats and some more hidden features, as well as some future QOL and development changes. I have some artists working on some exclusive art for the bot, while I continue to think and make small updates.

So, to the judges, and to anyone wanting to add the bot. I hope you enjoy it, and I hope your server friends enjoy it too!
